# Road Accident Data Analysis
This project is focused on analyzing road accident data to uncover insights about accident hotspots, unique accident spots for each road or highway, and other patterns. The goal is to process, visualize, and model the data to support decision-making for traffic management and safety improvements.

# Features
## Unique Accident Spot Analysis:

Calculate the number of unique accident spots for each road/highway.

Map these counts back to the dataset for further analysis.

## Baseline Model Setup:

Implementation of baseline classifiers (e.g., Dummy Classifiers) to establish a benchmark for prediction tasks.

## Model Training:

Train and evaluate classifiers like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for accident prediction based on accident spots and other features.

## Evaluation Metrics:

Generate confusion matrices to evaluate model performance.

Plot Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Area Under the Curve (AUC) for classification models.

## Pipeline and Preprocessing:

Use pipelines for streamlined preprocessing and modeling, including text vectorization and numerical feature scaling.
